# cublaSgemm-benchmark

A simple benchmark for validating the GPU performance based on cublas matrix multiplication API.

## How to run

Make sure your CUDA toolkit is setup (Your `nvcc` is on `$CUDA_PATH`, shared libraries on `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`). Then execute the following command to start the test:

./bin/gemm
